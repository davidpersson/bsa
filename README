Bsa can operate on single, multiple or all tubes, to select a set of tubes
to work with use the 'use' command. This way clearing buried jobs from
multiple tubes becomes very easy.
beanstalkd [*] > use fix flux
beanstalkd [fix, flux] > clear buried

The 'list' command shows the status of each selected tube - or if none
is selected - the status of all available tubes.
beanstalkd [fix, flux] > list
